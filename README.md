# Car Counter Project

## Overview
The **Car Counter Project** is a computer vision-based system designed to automatically count vehicles in a video stream or live feed. It utilizes **deep learning and image processing** techniques to detect and track cars efficiently.

## Features
- **Real-time car detection and counting**
- **Uses deep learning models** for accurate vehicle recognition
- **Handles occlusion and multiple lanes**
- **Displays live count overlay on video feed**
- **Optimized for performance** with minimal latency

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow / OpenCV / YOLO
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Model Used**: Pre-trained YOLO

## Usage
- Run the script with a video file or webcam feed.
- The program will detect and count cars in real time.
- Output is displayed with bounding boxes and a vehicle count overlay.

## Avoiding Overfitting
- Used **data augmentation** for better generalization.
- Applied **regularization techniques** to improve accuracy.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve accuracy with a fine-tuned deep learning model.
- Implement multi-object tracking (MOT) for better tracking.
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
